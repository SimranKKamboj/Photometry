This repository constitutes the Python, CL and IRAF codes that act as the pipeline to perform photometry on TransNeptunian Objects using IRAF. 

## A quick guide to use the pipeline:

The first and obvious step would be to obtain the FITS images. These codes are developed on images obtained using Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope under the CLASSY (The Classical and Large-a Distant Solar SYstem) Survey. So the pipeline only works once you have the calibrated images from the telescope/survey team. 

The work is divided into two stages:
1) Initial Stage - Preprocessing data.
2) Photometry Stage - Pipeline to get results from CSV files.
   
The initial stage consists of
