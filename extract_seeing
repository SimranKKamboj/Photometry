# Create a .cl file for psfmeasure using:

# Run obsutil in IRAF and run epar on psfmeasure if changes are required (change size to GFWHM)

# Store star coordinate/object coordinate for which you need the seeing in one.star
# add that to epar psfmeasure input coordinates file

# Run in IRAF:

# Run in terminal (case sensitive):
grep 'Full widith at half maximum (GFWHM) of' psf.txt | awk '{print $NF}' >> star1_seeing.txt
