# Reference stars are important to do absolute and relative photometry on TNOs

# Pick 5-7 unsaturated stars with instrumental mag between 18-20 (~11-12 on IRAF)
# Extract their coordinates (only x and y) using imexam and ",","a" and paste in one.star

# Run digiphot, daophot
# Run phot. Following are the parameters for phot that I have used:

image   =              @a.list  Input image(s)
coords  =        relative.star  Input coordinate list(s) (default: image.coo.?)
output  =     manual_err_19_18  Output photometry file(s) (default: image.mag.?)
skyfile =                       Input sky value file(s)
(plotfil=                     ) Output plot metacode file
(datapar=                     ) Data dependent parameters
(centerp=                     ) Centering parameters
(fitskyp=                     ) Sky fitting parameters
(photpar=                     ) Photometry parameters
(interac=                   no) Interactive mode?
(radplot=                   no) Plot the radial profiles?
(icomman=                     ) Image cursor: [x y wcs] key [cmd]
(gcomman=                     ) Graphics cursor: [x y wcs] key [cmd]
(wcsin  =             )_.wcsin) The input coordinate system (logical,tv,physical
(wcsout =            )_.wcsout) The output coordinate system (logical,tv,physica
(cache  =             )_.cache) Cache the input image pixels in memory?
(verify =            )_.verify) Verify critical phot parameters?
(update =            )_.update) Update critical phot parameters?
(verbose=           )_.verbose) Print phot messages?
(graphic=          )_.graphics) Graphics device
(display=           )_.display) Display device
(mode   =                   ql)

# You can change these three inputs after typing phot and pressing enter
# Save the file as .mag. For example, star1.mag

# Run pdump to extract OTIME,RAPERT,MAG,MERR,XAIRMASS,FLUX,SUM,PHOTZP etc.
# I have used a formula to calulate errors manually so for that, run Pdump by running epar pdump and changing fields to OTIME, AREA, MSKY, FLUX.

pdump > star1.txt 
pdump > star1.xlsx

# You will need to add the header later.
