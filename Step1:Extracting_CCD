# These commands should be run in the terminal and IRAF under the directory where images are stored

# Create a list of image names

ls 27788*p.fits > file_list.txt

# Create a raw list with the names raw1*.fits
# To do so, run the following and change 130 to however many frames you have

seq -w 101 130 | awk '{print "raw" $1 ".fits"}' > raw.list

# Create and run generate_extraction.sh to create extraction.cl
# Creating extraction.cl to rotate the images where [-*,-*] re-orients the images to North up and East left respectively. [4] is extracting the data of 4th CCD.
# Note: the directory should only contain the fits images for this step

# For the upper half of CFHT, we need [-*,-*] and for the lower half we need [*,*] or none.

#!/bin/bash

counter=101
while IFS= read -r file; do
  echo "imcopy $file[4][-*,-*] raw$counter" >> extraction.cl
  ((counter++))
done < <(ls)

# Optionally, you can specify a folder path:
# while IFS= read -r file; do
#   echo "imcopy $file[4][-*,-*] raw$counter" >> extraction.cl
#   ((counter++))
# done < <(ls /path/to/your/folder)

# And then run:
chmod +x generate_extraction.sh
./generate_extraction.sh


# This should return a list that looks something like this:

imcopy 27781p.fits[4][-*,-*] raw101
imcopy 27782p.fits[4][-*,-*] raw102
imcopy 27783p.fits[4][-*,-*] raw103
imcopy 27784p.fits[4][-*,-*] raw104

# Run extraction.cl in IRAF
cl < extraction.cl
